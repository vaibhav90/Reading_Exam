\section{Discovering SpatioTemporal Mobility Profiles of Cellphone Users~\cite{5282489}} \label{lect3}

\subsubsection*{Context}

In order to develop applications related to context-based search and advertising, inherent
in Location-Based Services, it is important to understand the mobility patterns and profiles of
users. These patterns need to be extracted from the raw GPS traces that are available from the 
cellphones. Different users have distinct behaviours that influence their mobility patterns, as 
a result it is crucial to discover these factors that affect the mobility path information
retrieval. This paper focuses on discovering the spatiotemporal mobility patterns and mobility
profiles from cell phone location logs.  
   
\subsubsection*{Problem}

Today, the LBS providers continuously monitor their users and log their location information, in 
the form of GPS coordinates. However, extracting meaningful information out of these raw traces is
a challenge due to the anomalies caused while tracking and user specific behaviour. On the 
contrary to the existing work that is restricted to small scale environments in order to 
study human mobility, this paper puts forth a framework named Mobility Profiler, for discovering user
mobility patterns and user profiles at a city wide level using cellular networks.  

\subsubsection*{Contributions}

The main contributions of the paper can be summarised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item The paper introduces formal definitions for the concepts of mobility path, mobility 
	pattern and mobility profile and the factors influencing each. 
	
	\item The authors design and implement the complete framework of Mobility Profiler to 
	discover mobility profiles from raw data. 
	
	\item The paper also presents several experiments conducted using the Reality Mining data 
	set to determine realistic thresholds for when to consider location end times, interim 
	location on a mobility path and others alike. 
	
	\item Previous studies have concluded that typical users spend 85~\% of their time in
	3 to 4 locations. The paper sheds light on user behaviour and patterns during the 
	remaining 15~\% of the time. 
		 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Approach}

The proposed Framework to build the mobility profiles has the following phases:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Path Construction. Here, an ordered set of cell tower IDs corresponding to 
	user's travel path is constructed. Cell clustering is further used to eliminate 
	oscillating between cell towers and replace them with their corresponding clusters. 
	
	\item Topology Construction. The extracted travel paths of cell clusters are used to 
	construct topology of user movements. 
	
	\item Pattern Discovery. Here, the frequent mobility patterns of each user are discovered. 
	This step is carried out by employing the topology information and a string matching 
	support criteria, i.e., for every subsequent pair of cell clusters in a sequence, the 
	former one should be a neighbour of the latter one in the cell-cluster topology graph. 
	
	\item Post Processing. The extracted personal mobility patterns are then used to generate
	cellphone user profiles. 
	 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize} 

	\item The authors find that the average duration spent in a cell is 10~min where it is 
	defined as the duration between the cell end time and the cell start time. The average
	cell transition time was also found to be 10~min where it is defined as the time duration
	between the subsequent cell start time and the current cell end time. These values were 
	experimentally found by analysing the ratio of cell span duration and cell span transitions,
	smaller than predefined time values in the experimental phase. 
	
	\item In order to determine the right cluster in the case of oscillations, it is important
	to determine the minimum switching count. The switching count is defined as the number 
	of times the network tower ID switches when a user is located in the same cell. It was 
	analytically found that in order to 	distinguish between oscillations due to user mobility 
	and cell tower oscillations the 	minimum switching threshold should be 3. 
		
	\item A single cell may encompass several points of interests that are masked by the resolution 
	offered by logging only the network tower ID which covers a large area. As a result, the thresholds 
	presented in the paper may not hold in practicality which consists of user mobility characterised 
	by short movements and stay times. It would be interesting to analyse how these parameters change 
	when they are applied to a dataset consisting of GPS logs mapped at a high frequency.
	
	\item Furthermore experiments were performed to discover patterns for generating both global
	and personal frequent patterns. It was found out that frequency 	of mobility paths is inversely
	correlated with the path-length. 
	
\end{itemize}
