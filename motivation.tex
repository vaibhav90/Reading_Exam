Mobility prediction is at the heart of my research subject. More specifically, the main goal concerns how to predict future locations of humans from their mobility traces. A wide number of techniques may be used to achieve it. Consequently, to gain a better overview of them, a better understanding of their accuracy and their complexity, I would like to focus the reading exam on these techniques. Since mobility prediction uses geolocated data and that mobility prediction must include security, I have also chosen a paper about security related to geolocated data. This work will be very helpful for my research.
